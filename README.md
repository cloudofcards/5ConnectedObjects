# 5 Connected Objects

5 Connected Objects is one of many possible physical implementations of the Cloud of Cards Processing Library and exemplifies its use, client side. Linked to the 5 Folders Cloud (both server and software sides), the five physical objects work exclusively as complements to it and have no independent digital functions of their own. They seek to offer a form of interface based on natural gestures (‘clients’ for the cloud) to enable users to locally access, monitor and manipulate their data or files in the distant cloud, with a Cloud of Cards twist. 

The purpose of 5 Connected Objects, which is directly linked to our design research findings and an ethnographic field study into the uses of the cloud, is to materialize the ‘ghostly’ presence of a user’s distant data in everyday environments. It also seeks to embody the ‘digital anxiety’ caused by mishaps that can happen to personal files and data when dropped into a distant cloud (fear of losing  files, anxiety about deleting versions, sharing with the wrong people, misunderstandings over access rights, having private files openly published, undesired updates, hacking, etc.) 

As a consequence, these objects, particularly when they are physically manipulated, can trigger automated procedures related to these potential problems…

The project was developed by Lucien Langton (ECAL / Cyberschnaps)

# Note
Only a part of the implementation of the code for the five objects has been initially realized, as a demonstrator. Notably, the object To_FREEZE is the one that has been developed the furthest to serve as example for the four others objects and for potential forks. The code is commented so to help distinguish the parts that are done versus the ones that are not yet.

You would probably as well be advised to also consult the "Cookbooks" (manuals and recipes) available online for a better understanding of the whole Cloud of Cards ecosystem:
